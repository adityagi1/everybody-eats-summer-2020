# Everybody Eats Summer 2020 Evanston Food Insecurity Project

## Purpose
This repository contains work I did as an analytics volunteer with the COVID-19 Task Force assembled the City of Evanston. Our goal was to understand the effect of COVID-19 on food insecurity in Evanston (and possibly the wider Chicago/Cook County area). By understanding these factors better, the Task Force would be able to better allocate resources and coordinate supply. 

## Mission
We addressed the problem by breaking the problem down in structural and COVID-19 Impact Factors. Structural factors are pre-existing factors affecting food insecurity in Evanston. COVID-19 Factors are those aspects of the food insecurity problem that became important after the advent of COVID-19 in the United States. For each type of factors, we used a plethora of datasets and then built predictive and inferential models. My team consisted of:
- Maura Shea (former VP Innovation at FeedingAmerica) - Team Lead
- Aria Wang, Doris Cao, myself - Data Science Team
- Vanessa Corbett, Mengxue Bi - Design Team
- Amy Smilowitz - Academic Advisor

## Organization
This repository is organized into:
- Documents: Deliverables, papers and other resources we used
- Notebooks: IPython Notebooks containing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, and modelling
- Plots: Visulizations 
- R Code: Contains R code used to build models

The Data folder is not included due to its large size as well as data integrity concerns. However, we are happy to share it with interested parties upon request.
